# Cafe Management System


Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Cafe Management System project! Iâ€™ve built this application to streamline cafe operations, from managing table assignments to preparing bills. Hereâ€™s a rundown of what it does and how you can use it.

## What This Project Does
### Table Assignment
Iâ€™ve made it easy to assign tables to waiters and manage customer counts. Youâ€™ll be able to see which waiter is responsible for each table and keep track of the number of customers at each table.

### Order Management
You can add items to orders, manage quantities, and handle prices effortlessly. This part of the application simplifies keeping track of all orders, so you can provide excellent service without hassle.

### Bill Preparation
Generating and viewing bills for each table is straightforward. Iâ€™ve designed this feature to help you prepare and save bills efficiently.

### Sale Completion
Completing sales and clearing table data is made simple. This helps you manage your transactions quickly and ensures that the system stays up-to-date.

### Cashup
With the cashup feature, you can view daily sales and clear the total if needed. Itâ€™s a handy tool for tracking your earnings and managing finances.

## How It Works
### Table and Order Management
Iâ€™ve set up the system to assign tables to waiters and manage customer counts through easy-to-follow prompts. You can add orders by specifying item names, quantities, and prices.

### Bill Generation
The system generates bills based on orders and customer counts. Each bill is saved to a file, so you can review and keep records as needed.

### Sale Completion and Cashup
Completing sales and managing daily cashup are streamlined for efficiency. This ensures that your operations run smoothly and that you can track your financials easily.

### Cafe Class
The cafe class is central to the application, handling customer data, orders, and billing. It includes attributes for item names, prices, and customer details.

## Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cafe-management-system.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd cafe-management-system

## Additional Notes
* The project consists of two main files:
  * cafeclass.py: Defines the cafe class with methods for managing tables, orders, and billing.
  * cafemain.py: Contains the main application logic and user interface.
* Bills are saved in text format with filenames based on user input.
